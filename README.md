# Youtube-Comment-Scrapper-with-Selenium

Small python script for scrapping youtube comments with Selenium and https://youtuberandomcomment.com/
downloads all comments to the current directory in a .json format.
links to the videos must be copied to videos.txt.(copy as many as you want!)

### Note :

https://youtuberandomcomment.com/ will crash if a video has too many comments . Works fine for videos with 2000-3000 comments
